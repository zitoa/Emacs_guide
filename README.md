# Background
Write here a 10 rows description.  
Emacs is a text-editor originally developed by.
Emacs is written in Lisp & C, 
The GNU Emacs is implemented in C, but also provides widely accessible Emacs-Lisp interfaces.
Follows a short guide on how to configure and use Emacs.

# Configuration and packages installation
When you open Emacs, it finds an initialization file. This a Lisp (*.el*) configuration file that specifies the instructions to configure and start an Emacs session. By default, Emacs will look for the following 3 files: $HOME/.emacs, $HOME/.emacs.el, $HOME/.emacs.d/init.el. If one of these file exists, Emacs will use it for initialization. The idea is to assign to the current user its own initialization file. The user-name that Emacs uses is specified by the environmental variables $LOGNAME and $USER. The $HOME directory accessed by Emacs is that corresponding to the that user-name. While these are its default behaviours, you can instruct Emacs to do not load the default initialization file (--no-init-file or -q) or look into another user's directory (--user, -u USER_NAME). Type *emacs --h* from your command line to view all starting options.

As an example in this context, I uploaded a basic initialization file. It instructs to: 
1) make available the MELPA (Milkypostmanâ€™s Emacs Lisp Package Archive) archive to install Emacs packages (~4000 packages); 
2) autocomplete code by using *global-company-mode* package - here coupled to *ggtags* package to autocomplete C++ code.
3) use default variables and faces/themes.
You can extensively modify it by adding more configuration options that fits to your needs.
